# Trusted Data Computing Platform
## PRODUCT CONCEPT 
Data circulation provides more possibilities for the discovery of data value. However, as data is a sensitive asset, data plaintext will bring security risks to data leakage. Trusted data computing uses data encryption technology to protect the original data, and uses multi-party computing to realize data ciphertext calculation. The entire process of data interaction is left on the chain. Data circulation is realized under the premise of ensuring data security, so that data can be exchanged between different institutions. Computing becomes possible, so as to obtain more value of big data integration.
## PRODUCT FEATURES
### 1. Secure multi-party computing
Each data party does not disclose the original data to perform a certain calculation task, conduct data encryption interaction, and obtain the value of multi-party data.
### 2. Custom script
Secure multi-party computing supports custom complex scripts, can realize complex calculation logic units, and can support machine learning algorithms in the future.
### 3. Monitoring and auditing on the data link
Block chain technology is used to record every interaction process of data to ensure that the data is not tampered with and the data can be traced.
### 4. Trusted Environment (SGX)
At the Intel chip hardware level, it is guaranteed that data calculations are executed in a trusted isolation domain environment to ensure that calculations are not maliciously attacked.
### 5. Homomorphic encryption
Use a variety of security encryption technologies to encrypt data or query information, and the entire data interaction process is data ciphertext to ensure data security.
